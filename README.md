# Comparison-of-Clustering-Algorithms
analyzing the performance of two methods (Hierarchical Clustering, K-Means Clustering) on various subsets of our county-level cancer risk data set.
In particular, comparing these two clustering methods in three areas:

*Efficiency - Which method computes clusterings more efficiently?

*Automation - Which method requires less human supervision to generate reasonable clusterings?

*Quality - Which method generates clusterings with less error?
